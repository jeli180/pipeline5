# need to store 32bit buses to dcache when DPU sends them 30 at a time (top 2 are status bits)
# 2 registers that hold pixel data: data_store (x1) where i lw into and data_send (x4) which will be sw to mem
# also an intermediary register x5 for bit ops 
# last_valid tracks the last valid bit in data_send, initialized to 0 | 1-32

# when there is a new valid data in x1, shift x1 left by last_valid into x5
# or x5 with data_send

# if last valid is greater or equal to 2, store data_send to memory since it is full
# shift x1 right by (32-last_valid) and store that into data_send (preserve bits that weren't used)
# subtract 2 from last valid

# else don't store data_send to memory
# add 30 to last valid
# don't need to preserve anything in x1 

# NOTE: the status bits don't affect anything since they aren't tracked with last status
# and are overwritten

# check if bit 32 is high, if so all pixel data has been sent and we can mask the first 16 bits of half full data_send 
# (get rid of status bits) and send to mem | this is because 3600 / 32 = 12.5
